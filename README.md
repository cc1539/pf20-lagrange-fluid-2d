# 2D Lagrangian Fluid Simulation

Uses a technique inspired by SPH to simulate fluids of multiple types, each with randomly determined interaction behavior.

Use the left mouse button to add particles, the right mouse button to drag particles, the number keys to change which type of particle you add, and press 'r' to randomize the physics.
